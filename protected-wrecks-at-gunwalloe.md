# Gunwalloe’s Three ‘Protected Wrecks’

## 1 St Anthony, PW 1000067; Portuguese carrack, wrecked 1527, Fishing Cove, Gunwalloe

### The Site and its Discovery

Discoveries of copper ingots at Fishing Cove led to investigation by diver Michael Hall and maritime historian and diver Richard Larn. The site was identified as wreckage from the royal Portuguese ship St Anthony, and was designated a PW in 1982. The ship was wrecked and many of her people drowned in 1527, on route from Antwerp to Lisbon. She carried a rich cargo, contested in the courts after the wreck; a history revealed in 1968 by John Trenoweth, descendant of one of the officers dealing with the disputes at the time.

Through licensed diving and research on the PW by Anthony Randall in the mid-1980s, many artefacts were recovered and identified, including remarkable little lion-shaped supporters for the base of a splendid brass candlestick. 

No undisturbed remains of the ship itself are known. As recorded in 1527, the ship struck at Porth Lingey, or Hingey ─ Hingey is a nearby farm, site of an ancient hamlet. This is probably the old Cornish name for Fishing Cove, re-named in English when its seine fishery was established. The seabed here has been mostly buried in sand since 1988. Search of a 'new' area in 2007 found scattered traces, rather than a coherent wreck site.

### The Story of the Wreck

This wreck has rare detailed documentation due to the disputes over the salvage. St Anthony was a 3 or 4 masted ‘carrack’, flagship of a fleet commanded by Antonio Pacheo for John (Joao) III of Portugal. Besides the ingots there were jewels, suits of armour, cloth, linen, musical and navigational instruments, candlesticks, and artillery, with pitch, tar, and other goods. Cannon of bronze and iron were also aboard to arm the ship.

When the anchors snapped in a foul gale, on January 19th, the master deliberately made for Loe Bar beach, but the ship struck a hidden reef, turned broadside on to the waves, and was pounded to pieces. Forty-five men, half the crew, managed to reach the shore. Goods were salvaged by the survivors and local people, but were fiercely contested.

The Portuguese claimed that local gentry Godolphin, St Aubyn and Milliton robbed them violently, with drawn swords and armed retinues. The three Cornish lords maintained they were sent for to prevent embezzlement of goods, and negotiated and paid for the salvage rights. Enquiries followed, and the case went to the Court of the Star Chamber. Records of the ruling were lost in the Civil War, but John Trenoweth found that the Cornish lords gained greatly, while Henry VIII ensured some return of goods or their value to Portugal.

Salvage recorded later in the 16th century included bronze guns (two went to Pendennis Castle), and, 50 years after the wreck, a silver pipe and chain weighing 1lb. Tradition attributes to the wreck the wooden screen that once embellished Gunwalloe Church.
